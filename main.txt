The formula is y = m((x-a(-+)|x-a|)/2)+b
the line will look something like this

        y-axis
          |
          |
          |     /
__________|____/
          |_____________ x- axis
          
a = a positive number you want you line to bend at
m = slope of bent line
b= y-intercept
for a fliped graph use "-" for rightside up use "+"
